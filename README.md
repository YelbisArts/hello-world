# hello-world
My first repository

This repository serves as the first project where I incorporate Java Script. 
It is a simple unit converter that takes specified measurements on input, then outputs on several types of measurement conversions.
The project is ongoing and serves to bolster simple fundamentals that may not seem so simple at first.
